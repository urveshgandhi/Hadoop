-> Client is very important very quick enough
-> if any files sits in RAM it's easily accessible (faster)
-> if create a large file save to HDD will taketime
-> when you resart your system RAM get flused away

=> What happended if Namenode faild or crashed what to do?????
========================================================

-> hadoop 2.0  came in picture with zookeeper
		hadoop fs - touchz /user/cloudera/.....
		hapdoop fs -get source path/ destination path
		hadoop fs -put source path/ destination path
		
		Edge node --> /home/ cloudera/
		HDFC --> /user/cloudera/
		
		
--> hadoop fs -text /user/cloudera/filename   (This command is use for shows the data in readable from )


---> What is the differce between (cat) and (text) command in hadoop?
		get --> from HDFS to edge node
		text --> Deserilize the data and show it
		
		serializedata --> not readable data
		
		Hadoop fs -appendToFile source path destination path
		
		
---> appendToFile  is to transfer the data not file


====> overwrite the file

		hadoop fs -put -f source path destination path
		
		
====>  Issue in RDMS 
		-> extremely slow data transmission
		-> edge node burden
		-> pr=ortion of data imports
		-> incremantal data imports
		-> modified data imports
		-> serialized data imports
		-> export the data
		
		
========================================================
Hadoop --- High Avaibility 

Namenode --- Active Namenode (in_ise.lock)
			you do not Edit logs with you
			Recruited a new Guy- Give it to hime  -- (Journal Nodes)
			
SNN --	--- Stand by Name Nodee
			As usual do your work but read Edit logs from Journal Nodes
			wait for my instruction
			
DataNode --- DataNodes Connect with both the Namenode
			 But send the information only to the Namenode having in_use.lock
